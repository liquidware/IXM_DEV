SUMMARY
=======

IXM_DEV is a place for advanced application development on the
Illuminato X Machina (IXM) hardware platform. The Illuminato X Machina is
a modular computing system, infinitely scalable and robust.

QUICK START
===========

1. Install the IDE on your Windows, Mac, or Linux System

If you like using the command line, you can also build and upload the sources
using apache-ant or Make build tools.

2. Write some code.

The most basic sketches usually start out like this:

     void setup() {
        /* Insert Setup code */
     }

     void loop() {
        /* Main loop code */
     }

3. Send the sketch to the IXM.

Code is uploaded to the IXM through the USB serial connection by clicking the
upload button in the IDE.
